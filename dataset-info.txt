tii-ssrc-23: 6m malicious only

the dataset is cleaned by removing nan,inf.
total: 26m720 malicious, 15m990 benign

split 20% testing, 70% training, 10% valid for each dataset

all traning part are concat and then balanced. the validation are also done the same.
the testing is tested both balanced and unbalanced.

the final dataset:
+ Each dataset is splitted inside their own folder. They are splitted into testing, training and validation
+ The training part then are sampled
+ All of the training part in each folder are then concatenated inside the final folder. Same with validation
+ The testing is held inside each folder, and each test is done both balanced and unbalanced
+ The csv folder contains data for CLI example: a traing csv file, a testing csv file, a base csv file for getting more data, and an inference csv file for inferencing unknown data.
